# üçΩÔ∏è Food Munch - Contactless Food Ordering System

**Food Munch** is a contactless food ordering system built entirely in Python using the Tkinter library. This system allows users to scan a QR code placed on the table, view the menu, and place their orders without needing a waiter.

## üöÄ Features
- Contactless food ordering by scanning a QR code.
- Simple and intuitive interface using the Tkinter library.
- Fully built using Python, ensuring smooth functionality.
- Easy-to-use design that enhances customer experience in restaurants.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **GUI**: Tkinter Library


## üóíÔ∏è Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Virtual environment (`venv`) to isolate project dependencies.
- `__pycache__` for managing compiled bytecode files.

### Install Required Libraries:
1. Ensure you have Python installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Set up a virtual environment for this project to avoid conflicts with other projects:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tkinter
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already activated):
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Run the Tkinter application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will launch the GUI interface for the Food Munch system, where customers can scan their QR codes and start ordering food from their table.
